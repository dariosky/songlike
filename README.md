#### a bot to ameliorate your Spotify experience

----
Note:

If the description seems too generic, is just because at the moment
I don't know what the bot is going to do :)

Trust me - it's going to be awesome

----

At the moment this is a CLI interface, it will launch a bot that does
magic with your Spotify account.

If you install it via pip - you'll get a `spotlite` command.

First you'll have to link it to your Spotify account, it should
be as easy as

```shell script
spotlike auth
```

That will open a browser kindly asking to confirm, and you're set.

...

That's it - it will show you a few of your songs, but stay tuned:
the magic still has to come.
