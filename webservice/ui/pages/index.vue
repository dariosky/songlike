      Spotlike will help you turning your Spotify experience from fantastic
      to... more than fantastic.
    </p>
    <p>
      It gives you connect to your Spotify account to add some smart feature
      around your listening habits and automating some of the boring tasks.
    </p>

    <h2>Here's what it does</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3>Sync your aliked songs to a playlist</h3>
        The songs you like the most are in the "Liked songs".<br />
        What do you want to share with your friends? The songs you like.<br />
        Can you share your "Liked songs" playlist? No, cause it's not a
        playlist!<br />
        Stop crying, we got you covered.<br />
        (You may have guessed already from the title of this feature, I knew you
        were smart!)
      </li>

      <li>
        <h3>Remove duplicates from your liked songs</h3>
        Your favorite song has been published in a new album - but it's the
        exact same song, so even if you REALLY like it Spotlike will remove
        these duplicates keeping just the older one (I know it's
        heart-breaking).
      </li>
